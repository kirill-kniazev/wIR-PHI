# wIR-PHI System Overview

The **wIR-PHI** system operates using the **Photron S12 camera**. This concept was initially introduced in 2019 by the Cheng group and later finalized in 2023 by the Kuno and Hartland groups, achieving 20,000 frames per second (fps).

## Requirements

To use this system, ensure that the latest version of the **PVF4 GUI** is installed.

## Configuration Instructions

### Step 1: Configure the Camera

Before running the software, the camera must be properly configured. This can be done easily by running one of the following scripts:
- **`Apply_Camera_Settings.py`** (runs with a console)
- **`Apply_Camera_Settings.pyw`** (runs without a console)

When the script is executed, the camera settings will automatically be applied. Afterward, the script will trigger the opening of the **PVF4** interface, allowing you to adjust the hardware cropping settings.

### Step 2: Adjust the Stage (X, Y, Z) and Image Positioning

After the camera configuration is complete, leave the **PVF4** software open and run one of the following scripts to adjust the X, Y, and Z positions of the stage:
- **`Image_Positioning.py`** (with a console)
- **`Image_Positioning.pyw`** (without a console)

</div>

This step is essential for adjusting the image focus and aligning the region of interest for imaging.

### Step 3: Start Image Collection

Once the setup is complete, close the **PVF4** application to free up the camera communication channel. Then, start the **Image Collection** process by running either:
- **`Image_Collection.py`** (with a console)
- **`Image_Collection.pyw`** (without a console)

<div align="center">
    <img src="Image_Collection_GUI.png" width="35%">
</div>

In this application, you will be able to see the real-time visible illumination image from the camera. When the desired wIR-PHI imaging wavelength is selected, click the **Apply** button. This action will trigger the laser to adjust to the selected wavelength, and the motor mirror correction will also be adjusted accordingly. Once the wavelength is set, the **Collect IR Image** button will become enabled.

### Step 4: Collect and Save the IR Image

Once the **Collect IR Image** button is clicked, the IR image will be displayed in the same window. At this point, the **Apply Parameters** and **Collect** buttons will be disabled, but the **Save** and **Live Imaging** buttons will become available.

- **Saving the Image**: When the **Save** button is clicked, a new folder named **Measurements** will be created outside of the repository. Within this folder, the captured images will be saved in `.txt` format, and the **Save** button will be disabled.
- **Live Imaging**: The **Live Imaging** button allows you to view real-time imaging.

5 spectra collection

<div align="center">

here you have to close image colection window and oprn spectra colection window.

in this window you have to enter scanning waveelgth range and a vavelenght step. adb clic apply paramters. this will trigger the lase and moror motor to go to th initial positions.

then enter sample name and clcj colecna ddave spectra, what will stat the hyperpectral image colectiona and the automatically will save it. for anaylysi of the hyperspectra images please see git kirill-kniaze Hyperspectral Image Analysus repo.

after data is collected and save clicl live image to go back to real time visible light image.

## Software Compatibility

This software has been tested with **Python 3.10**.


new section - experiments

here is introduction of the experimental function for the wir-phi: scanning widefield imaging.

idea is simple: utilise the ideas of the classical scanning ir-phi and wirphi. where wide field images are collected at different regions of the sample and the stiched togater to retrive photothermal imformation of the extrimelly large areas of the samples.

to ruth this gui use image scanning py or pyw.
